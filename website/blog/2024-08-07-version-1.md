# Cheerio 1.0 Released, Batteries Included üîã

Cheerio 1.0 is out! After 12 release candidates and just a short seven years
after the initial 1.0 release candidate, it is finally time to call Cheerio 1.0
complete. The theme for this release is "batteries included", with common use
cases now supported out of the box.

So grab a pair of double-As, and read below for what's new, what's changed, and
how to upgrade!

<!--truncate-->

## New Website and Documentation

Since the last release, we've published a new website and documentation for
Cheerio. The new site features detailed guides and API documentation to get the
most from Cheerio. Check it out at [cheerio.js.org](https://cheerio.js.org/).

## A new way to load documents

Loading documents into Cheerio has been revamped. Cheerio now supports multiple
loading methods, each tailored to different use cases:

- `load`: The classic method for parsing HTML or XML strings.
- `loadBuffer`: Works with binary data, automatically detecting the document
  encoding.
- `stringStream` and `decodeStream`: Parse HTML directly from streams.
- `fromURL`: Fetch and parse HTML from a URL in one go.

Dive deeper into these methods in the
[Loading Documents](http:///docs/basics/loading) tutorial.

## Simplified Data Extraction

The new `extract` method allows you to extract data from an HTML document and
store it in an object. To fetch the latest release of Cheerio from GitHub and
extract the release date and the release notes from the release page is now as
simple as:

```ts
import * as cheerio from 'cheerio';

const $ = await cheerio.fromURL(
  'https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio/releases',
);
const data = $.extract({
  releases: [
    {
      // First, we select individual release sections.
      selector: 'section',
      // Then, we extract the release date, name, and notes from each section.
      value: {
        // Selectors are executed within the context of the selected element.
        name: 'h2',
        date: {
          selector: 'relative-time',
          // The actual release date is stored in the `datetime` attribute.
          value: 'datetime',
        },
        notes: {
          selector: '.markdown-body',
          // We are looking for the HTML content of the element.
          value: 'innerHTML',
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Read more about all of the available options in the
[Extracting Data](/docs/advanced/extract) guide.

## Breaking Changes and Upgrade Guide

Cheerio 1.0 introduces several breaking changes, most notably:

- The minimum NodeJS version is now 18.17 or higher.
- Import paths were simplified. For example, use `cheerio/slim` instead of
  `cheerio/lib/slim`.
- The deprecated default Cheerio instance and static methods were removed.

  Before, it was possible to write code like this:

  ```ts
  import cheerio, { html } from 'cheerio';

  html(cheerio('<test></test>')); // ~ '<test></test>' -- NO LONGER WORKS
  ```

  Make sure to always load documents first:

  ```ts
  import * as cheerio from 'cheerio';

  cheerio.load('<test></test>').html();
  ```

- htmlparser2 options now reside exclusively under the `xml` key:

  ```ts
  const $ = cheerio.load('<html>', {
    xml: {
      withStartIndices: true,
    },
  });
  ```

- Node types previously re-exported by Cheerio must now be imported directly
  from [`domhandler`](https://github.com/fb55/domhandler).

For a comprehensive list of changes, please consult
[the changelog](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio/releases).
